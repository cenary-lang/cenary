# Cenary

A Language and its compiler targeting Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## Standard

[This repository](https://github.com/cenary-lang/standard) contains information about the language standards.

## Current Development Status

Cenary is being very actively developed, and we often introduce backward-incompatible changes to the language; hence we don't have proper documentation yet. If you want to see what language and its syntax looks like, you can explore [tests](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/tree/master/test/sources) directory.
