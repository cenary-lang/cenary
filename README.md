*Announcement!* We've renamed Ivy into Cenary. Pdf versions of progress reports may refer the language as Ivy.

# Cenary

A Language and its compiler targeting Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## Syntax

[Here](https://github.com/yigitozkavci/cenary/blob/master/standard/cenary.abnf), you can find the language syntax in ABNF form. (a bit outdated, PRs welcome).

## Language Reports

Cenary started as a 1-year senior project and continues being actively developed. In each term, a progress report has been written for that term's development, hence there are 4 reports:

* [Term 1 Midterm Prograss Report](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/blob/master/standard/report_491_midterm/report.pdf)
* [Term 1 Final Progress Report](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/blob/master/standard/report_491_final/report.pdf)
* [Term 2 Midterm Progress Report](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/blob/master/standard/report_492_midterm/report.pdf)
* [Term 2 Final Progress Report](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/blob/master/standard/report_492_final/report.pdf)

## Current Development Status

Cenary is being very actively developed, and we often introduce backward-incompatible changes to the language; hence we don't have proper documentation yet. If you want to see what language and its syntax looks like, you can explore [tests](https://github.com/cenary-lang/cenary/tree/master/test/sources) directory.
